.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is, as the name, a simple command line interpreter, that provides a command line user interface 
meaning that it reads lines from either file or terminal (standard input), interprets them, and executes commands. The first Unix 
shell was the Thompson shell, sh, written by Ken Thompson.

.B <3 ./hsh

.SH BUILTINS
